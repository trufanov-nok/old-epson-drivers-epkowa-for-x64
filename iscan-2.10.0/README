1  Preamble

During our contact with the Free Software Foundation to straighten out
the licensing problems with "Image Scan! for Linux" we noticed that we
needed to clear up what parts are distributed under which conditions.
Here is an attempt.

"Image Scan! for Linux" contains the following parts:

  iscan			the program you use to scan your images
  libsane-epkowa	an improved driver for EPSON scanners
  libesmod		a proprietary module used by iscan

The latter module is provided (in object code form only) under the
terms of the license agreement provided in `non-free/EAPL.en.txt'.
The module is linked against libraries from the `glibc' package
which is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The `iscan' program is covered by the GNU General Public License with
a special exception that allows linking with the `libesmod' module.

The libsane-epkowa driver is released under the same conditions as
the SANE backends, that is under the GNU General Public License with a
special exception that allows linking a SANE library with other files
to produce an executable.

Unless explicitly noted otherwise in the file itself, all other files
in the non-free/ directory are copyright SEIKO EPSON Corporation and
distributed under the terms of the EPSON AVASYS Public License (see
non-free/EAPL.en.txt).

Copies of the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General
Public License can be found in the files `COPYING' and `COPYING.LIB',
respectively.

The `iscan' program supports the following scanners:

2  Version Up Record

   [moved to NEWS file]


3  Operating Condition

- Kernel 2.4.3 or later is required when connecting your scanner by USB.
- Kernel 2.4.8 or later is required when connecting Perfection 1250/
  Perfection 1250 PHOTO and Perfection 1260/Perfection 1260 PHOTO.
- The hard disk requires at least double size of an image data size to
  be scanned.


4  Installation Method

It is required that the following packages are installed previous to 
the installation of Image Scan! for Linux.
 - sane-backends

4-1  Installing a rpm file

NOTE: The RPMs provided by EPSON AVASYS Corporation have been built on
      RedHat 9 with gimp-devel from RHEL4 added for GIMP2 support.

Execute the following rpm command to complete the installation.

  # rpm -i iscan-${version}-${release}.i386.rpm

where you should substitute the version of your Image Scan! for Linux
for ${version}-${release}.  So, if you downloaded iscan-1.5.1-5, then
the ${version} part would be 1.5.1 and the ${release} part would be 5.

Depending on the distribution, dependency errors may occur. 
Running the following command will suppress dependency checks,
and complete the installation.

  # rpm -i --nodeps iscan-${version}-${release}.i386.rpm

If an old version of Image Scan! for Linux  exists, 
run the following command and update to the latest version.

  # rpm -U iscan-${version}-${release}.i386.rpm

Note that the installation of Image Scan! for Linux from rpm requires 
that sane has been installed from rpm as well.

4-2  Installing a tar file

Execute the following command to complete the installation.

  # tar -zxvf iscan-${version}-${release}.tar.gz
  # cd iscan-${version}
  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install

Note that the installation of Image Scan! for Linux from tar requires 
that sane has been installed from tar as well.


5  Running the Software

At the command prompt, execute the following command to
start Image Scan! for Linux.

  $ iscan 


6  Options

Normally, installating a binary package will register iscan as a GIMP
plugin.  In case this did not happen, or you compiled and installed
iscan from source, you can register it as a plugin yourself with the
following command:

  $ ln -s /usr/bin/iscan ~/.gimp-1.2/plug-ins/

Adjust the version number to match the version of the GIMP that you
use (and /usr/bin to wherever iscan was installed).  If you want to
make it available system wide, you can do that with:

  # ln -s /usr/bin/iscan `gimptool --gimpplugindir`/plug-ins/

If the GIMP complains something like

  duplicate plug-in: "/usr/lib/gimp/1.2/plug-ins/iscan"

Just remove ~/.gimp-1.2/plug-ins/iscan and all should be fine.

In order to print from directly from Image Scan! for Linux, your print
system needs to be able to handle the PNG file format directly.  CUPS
does this by default.  Furthermore, Photo Image Print System, versions
1.3.1 and later, will also work out of the box.

The latest version of Photo Image Print System can be downloaded via:

7  Limitations

8 Known problems

======================================================================
 - A printer configuration dialog keeps appearing after every single
   scan action.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 + This has been confirmed on FC6 and you can fix the problem with an
   upgrade of the `hal-cups-utils` package.  Version 0.6.9-1.fc6 has
   been confirmed to solve it.
   You will need to configure the printer part of the device to use a
   HAL device URI, that is, something that starts with `hal:///` (of
   course without the quotes), via the CUPS web interface or Fedora's
   `system-config-printer` utility.  If you can configure the printer
   via the `Specify Printer Driver` dialog, that should also work and
   is probably easier for most.
