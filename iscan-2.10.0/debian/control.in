Description: simple, easy to use scanner utility for EPSON scanners
 Image Scan! is a graphical scanner utility for people that do not need
 all the bells and whistles provided by several of the other utilities
 out there (xsane, QuiteInsane, Kooka).
 .
 At the moment it only supports SEIKO EPSON scanners and all-in-ones.
 However, the scanner driver it provides can be used by any other SANE
 standard compliant scanner utility.
 .
 Note that several scanners require a non-free plugin before they can
 be used with this software.
